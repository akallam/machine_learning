### What's Inside?

This repository contains well-documented Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts that demonstrate my understanding of the machine learning pipeline. Each project includes:

* **Problem Statement**: A clear definition of the project's goal.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Insights and visualizations derived from the data.
* **Data Preprocessing**: Handling of missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.
* **Model Building**: Implementation of various machine learning algorithms.
* **Model Evaluation**: Assessment of model performance using key metrics.
* **Conclusion**: Summary of findings and potential next steps for improvement.
